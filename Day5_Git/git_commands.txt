git Commands:
--------------

$git add .   (file name)

->It will add files/folders from current folder to the cache/local git repository / stage
-> this action is known as staging

$ git status
-> It is to check status of added files or to check which set of files staged/added  and which set of files unstaged/not added.

$ git commit -m "Any commit related message"
-> it will store/save all files and folders into local git repository.
-> and ready to push to the remote repository

$ git push origin master

-> It will push all files and folders from local repo to the remote repository which is presentated by nick name/alias name "origin" , and  "master" is the branch name.




Note: While doing above process very first time github server asked git client to verify username,email and password for authentication purpose. It is only one time process.

User Authentication:

git config  --global user.name "git_user_name"

git config  --global  user.email  "git_user_email_id"

Note: Here , try to choose browser option for authentication/verification process.





Now , let see how other users/team mates can access our repositories.


$ git clone  https://github.com/username/RepoName.git

-> it will used to clone others repository into our system/machine.
 We need not to say "git init" in this case because it is optional 

Note: Use git clone option only very first time to clone repository.

Then after use pull command everytime you want to update / pull  data from remote repository.


$ git pull  https://github.com/username/RepoName.git  branch_name





$git rm  --cached File_name/folder_name 
->it will help us to remove anything from staged / cache

$git restore --staged file_name/folder_name 
->it will help us to restor anything from staged / cache

Note: both rm , restore help us to unstaged files/folders
